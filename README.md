### Description

Its a casino style slot machine, runs fine now, but there are still a few things I plan to add to it to make it better. You can place bets on 8 lines, with a total of 4 bets per line. Good GUI example, and commentted as well as I now how to. So maybe someone just starting can see how things work.
